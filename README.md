React take-home challenge

This is not complete stage at all. It has some bugs in filters and search. It is still in development state.

## Setup
1. run `npm install` or `yarn install`
2. create `.env.local` in root directory by referencing from `.env-example`.
3. run `npm dev` or `yarn dev`

Then dev server will start if everything is fine.
